Chandler Lutz is an Associate Professor of Finance and the Steven Ott Distinguished Scholar in Real Estate in the Belk College of Business at UNC Charlotte. He also is a research fellow at the [UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/about/centers/ucla-ziman-center-for-real-estate/faculty-and-research/ucla-gilbert-program-in-real-estate-finance-and-urban-economics). His research employs econometric, statistical, and machine learning methods in the study of housing markets, labor economics, and monetary policy. 


Chandler's research has been published in the [*Review of Financial Studies*](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/34/2/864/5842150), the [*Journal of Labor Economics*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/703579), and the [*Journal of Urban Economics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119016300419), among other outlets. In recent work, he has developed [new datasets](https://github.com/ChandlerLutz/LandUnavailabilityData) that measure the amount of [land unavailable for housing construction](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3478900) across the United States and causally assessed the impact of [interest rate declines on distressed borrowers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3869199). While at the SEC, Chandler's policy work spanned housing markets, financial risk, and macroeconomic analysis.
