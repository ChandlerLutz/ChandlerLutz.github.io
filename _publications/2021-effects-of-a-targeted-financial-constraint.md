* Key Highlight: This paper studies how financial constraints affect the housing market by exploiting a regulatory change that increases the down payment requirement for homes selling for 1M dollars or more. Result shows that the policy causes excess bunching of homes listed at \$1M and heightened bidding intensity for these homes, but only a muted response in sales.
