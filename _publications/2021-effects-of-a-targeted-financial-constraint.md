* Key Highlight: We study how financial constraints affect the housing market by exploiting a regulatory change that increases the down payment requirement for homes selling for $1M or more. Result shows that the policy causes excess bunching of homes listed at $1M and heightened bidding intensity for these homes, but only a muted response in sales.
